Manishop admin dashboard is an app that controls everything in Manishop online store.

I use next13js with typescript for the front end and PHP with MySQL in the back end.

The admin user gets full information about his store from sales to total revenue and product in stock on the dashboard page.

The admin user can create/update/delete a category on the categories page.
The admin user can create/update/delete a subcategory on the subcategories page.
The admin user can create/update/delete a product on the products page.
The admin user can see the orders he has from his clients with name, number, location, and product bought.
The admin user can create/update/delete a blog on the blogs page.
